# Alt Tag Generator

This web application automatically generates descriptive alt tags for images using a powerful vision-language model. It supports both the Hugging Face API for cloud-based inference and local models via Ollama.

The app provides a simple gallery view of all processed images along with their generated descriptions and an option to export the results to an Excel file. This tool is designed to help improve web accessibility by making it easy to create meaningful alt text for visual content.

## Features

-   **Automatic Alt Tag Generation**: Scans a local directory for images and generates descriptive captions.
-   **Flexible AI Backends**:
    -   **Hugging Face**: Use the `nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning` model via the Inference API.
    -   **Ollama**: Connect to a locally running Ollama instance to use models like `llava` for full privacy and offline capability.
-   **Web Gallery**: Displays images and their alt tags in a clean, user-friendly web interface.
-   **Excel Export**: Allows you to download a list of all image filenames, their corresponding alt tags, and the backend used, in a single `.xlsx` file.
-   **In-Memory Caching**: Image data is cached in memory to prevent reprocessing, making downloads and page loads instant after the first scan.
-   **Full Control**: A simple UI with "Refresh" and "Clear" buttons gives you full control over the cache.
-   **Easy to Configure**: Switch between backends by changing a single environment variable.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Usage

Follow these steps to run the application on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   **For Hugging Face backend:** A Hugging Face account with an API Access Token.
-   **For Ollama backend:** A local installation of [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) with a vision model pulled (e.g., `ollama pull llava`).

### 2. Installation

First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```

Next, install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configuration

The application is configured using a `.env` file.

1.  **Create a `.env` file** by copying the example:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2.  **Edit the `.env` file** to choose and configure your backend.

    **To use Hugging Face (default):**
    -   Set `AI_BACKEND="huggingface"`.
    -   Add your Hugging Face API key to `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY`.

    **To use Ollama:**
    -   Make sure Ollama is running on your machine.
    -   Set `AI_BACKEND="ollama"`.
    -   Verify the `OLLAMA_MODEL` is correct for your setup.
    -   If your Ollama server is not at the default `http://localhost:11434`, set the `OLLAMA_HOST` variable.

    *Example `.env` for Ollama:*
    ```
    AI_BACKEND="ollama"
    HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY="" # Not needed for Ollama
    OLLAMA_HOST="http://localhost:11434"
    OLLAMA_MODEL="llava"
    ```

### 4. Add Images

Place any images you want to process into the `static/images` directory.

### 5. Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, you can start the Flask web server:
```bash
python app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. When you first visit, the gallery will be empty.

-   Click the **Refresh Gallery** button to scan the `static/images` directory and generate alt text for all images. This is ideal for processing images stored locally with the application.
-   If you add or remove images from the folder, click **Refresh Gallery** again to update the view.
-   Click **Clear Cache** to empty the gallery.

#### Processing Images via Excel Upload

Alternatively, you can process a list of images from an Excel file. This is useful for images located anywhere on your file system or on the web.

1.  Create an Excel file (`.xlsx`) with two columns: `Image Name` and `Image Path`. The path can be a local file path (e.g., `/path/to/my/image.jpg`) or a public URL (e.g., `http://example.com/image.png`).
2.  Use the "Process Images from Excel File" form on the main page to upload your file.
3.  The application will process each path from the file and load the results into the gallery. Note that this will replace any existing data in the gallery.

#### Applying Alt Tags to an HTML File

After you have generated a set of alt tags and they are visible in the gallery, you can apply them to an existing HTML file.

1.  Use the "Apply Cached Alt Tags to HTML File" form to upload your HTML file.
2.  The application will find `<img>` tags in your HTML whose `src` attribute contains the filename of an image in the cache.
3.  For each match, it will inject the generated alt text into the `alt` attribute.
4.  A new, modified HTML file will be provided for you to download.
5.  The application will also notify you if any images from the cache were not found in your HTML file.

## üß™ Running Tests

This project includes a suite of unit tests to ensure the core logic is working correctly for both backends. To run the tests, execute the following command from the root directory of the project:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
